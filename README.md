# MCQSolver
 
This is a Flask web application that generates answers to questions using the OpenAI API. The user inputs a question and a list of options, and the application uses the OpenAI API to generate a response. The response is then displayed to the user on the web page. The application is built using Python, Flask, and jQuery. The Python code communicates with the OpenAI API, and the jQuery code handles the form submission and API response. The application is a useful tool for anyone who needs to generate answers to questions quickly and accurately.
